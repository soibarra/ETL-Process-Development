# ETL Process Development

This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Python. The pipeline processes healthcare data, cleans it, and loads it into a SQLite database.

## Files
- `input_data.csv`: Sample input dataset.
- `etl_pipeline.py`: Python script for the ETL process.
- `etl_log.txt`: Log file to track the ETL process (generated automatically).
- `etl_output.db`: SQLite database containing the processed data.

## Instructions
1. Place your input CSV file in the project directory.
2. Run the ETL pipeline script:
   ```bash
   python etl_pipeline.py
